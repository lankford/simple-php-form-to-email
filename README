ABOUT:
Simple Form To Email is a script that will take any data from an HTML form and send it to a pre-configured email address.

FEATURES:
You can create as many HTML forms as you like and submit them to the same URL
Email can formatted in XML so that you can parse for a database
Email can be formatted in YAML for easy human readable format
XML or YAML format can be specified from each HTML form
The email subject is set from each HTML form so you can keep track of what form the data is coming from
After the form is processed, you can redirect the user to another page ... like http://mydomain.com/Thankyou from the form

REQUIREMENTS:
A webserver with PHP 4.x Plus

SETTINGS:

You can set the from address in a hidden form like the following:
<input type="hidden" name="From" value="me@mydomain.com" />
The "From" is case sensitive

You can set the format in a hidden form like the following:
<input type="hidden" name="Format" value="xml" />
The "Format" and "xml" are case sensitive

You can set the email subject in a hidden form like the following:
<input type="hidden" name="Subject" value="My Email Subject" />
The "Subject" is case sensitive

You can set the redirect page in a hidden form like the following:
<input type="hidden" name="Redirect" value="http://mydomain.com/thankyou.html" />
The "Redirect" is case sensitive

Set this line to the address you want the email to be sent to.
DO NOT set this from your form... it is a MAJOR security hole
that will open your server up as an open relay and get you banned from the
entire Internet for all time
