Works with PHP 4.x Plus

You can set the from address in a hidden form like the following:
<input type="hidden" name="From" value="me@mydomain.com" />
The "From" is case sensitive

You can set the format in a hidden form like the following:
<input type="hidden" name="Format" value="xml" />
The "Format" and "xml" are case sensitive

You can set the email subject in a hidden form like the following:
<input type="hidden" name="Subject" value="My Email Subject" />
The "Subject" is case sensitive

You can set the redirect page in a hidden form like the following:
<input type="hidden" name="Redirect" value="http://mydomain.com/thankyou.html" />
The "Redirect" is case sensitive

Set this line to the address you want the email to be sent to.
DO NOT set this from your form... it is a MAJOR security hole
that will open your server up as an open relay and get you banned from the
entire Internet for all time
